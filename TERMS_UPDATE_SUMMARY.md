# Terms of Service Update Summary

## ✅ All Issues Fixed

### 1. **Legal Requirement Question - ANSWERED** ✓

**Q:** Is Terms of Service required without an "I Agree" screen?

**A:** YES, you still need it because:
- ✅ **Google Play Store** requires it for published apps
- ✅ **OAuth consent screen** requires it (your issue #2)
- ✅ **Legal protection** - "By using the app, you agree" is standard
- ✅ **User trust** - shows professionalism
- ✅ **Industry standard** - all apps have ToS

**No "I Agree" button needed** - implicit acceptance by use is the norm.

### 2. **Formatting Issue - FIXED** ✓

**Problem:** Markdown inside `<div class="section-highlight">` wasn't rendering (showed ### and **)

**Solution:** Removed the div wrapper and used clean markdown with emojis:
- ⚡ **Floating Sidebar**
- 🤖 **AI Summary**
- 🎧 **AI Read**
- 💾 **Save Content**
- 🔍 **Organization**
- ☁️ **Google Drive Backup**

Now renders beautifully with proper formatting!
