## 3. User Accounts

---

## 4. Permissions and Data Access

Arc requires specific Android permissions to function. We are transparent about what we request and why:

| Permission | Purpose | When Active |
| :--------- | :------ | :---------- |
| **Accessibility Service** | Read on-screen text and capture screenshots (with consent) | Only when you explicitly tap a sidebar action (AI Summary, AI Read, Save Content, Custom Action, or Chat). **Never** runs in the background or monitors your screen automatically. |
| **Display Over Other Apps (Overlay)** | Show the floating sidebar on top of other applications | When the sidebar service is running (you can close it anytime) |
| **Internet / Network State** | Communicate with AI services and our backend | When using AI features or Google Sign-In |
| **Foreground Service** | Keep the floating sidebar service running while you use other apps | When sidebar is active (shows persistent notification) |
| **Receive Boot Completed** | Optionally restart sidebar service after device reboot | Only if you enable auto-start in settings |
| **Media Projection (Android 11+)** | Capture screenshots when you tap "Save Content" or enable screenshots for custom actions/chat | **Only when you grant explicit screenshot permission** and initiate the action. Never automatic. |
| **Query All Packages** | Display list of installed apps in App Management settings | Used locally only to let you enable/disable Arc for specific apps. This data never leaves your device. |

**Important:** We never monitor your screen in the background. Text extraction and screenshot capture occur **only** when you explicitly tap an action button in the sidebar. You maintain complete control.

---
