## Welcome to Arc

Thank you for choosing Arc: AI Reader & Summary ("Arc", "we", "our", or "the App"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Arc, our floating sidebar application that provides AI-powered summaries, text-to-speech, and content saving features for Android devices.

**By downloading, installing, or using Arc, you agree to be bound by these Terms.** If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.

---

* You are at least 13 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction)
* You have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms
* You will comply with all applicable laws and regulations
* You understand that the App requires certain permissions to function as intended

---

## 2. Description of Service

**⚡ Floating Sidebar:** A persistent overlay interface accessible from any app (requires Display Over Other Apps permission)

**🤖 AI Summary:** Generates concise summaries of on-screen text using Google Gemini API

**🎧 AI Read:** Converts on-screen text to speech using your device's built-in Text-to-Speech engine

**🔍 Organization:** Search, categorize, and manage your saved summaries

**☁️ Google Drive Backup:** Optional backup and restore to Google Drive (requires separate consent)

**Minimum Requirements:** Android 7.0 (API 24) or higher. Screenshot feature requires Android 11+.

---

## 3. User Accounts

**Guest Mode:** Use core features without an account.

**Google Sign-In (Optional):** For Drive backup and future premium features. We collect only your Google ID and email (no name or profile picture). You're responsible for account security and can delete your account anytime by contacting us.

---

## 4. Permissions and Data Access

Arc requires specific Android permissions to function. We are transparent about what we request and why:

| Permission | Purpose | When Active |
| :--------- | :------ | :---------- |
| **Accessibility Service** | Read on-screen text and capture screenshots (with consent) | Only when you explicitly tap a sidebar action (AI Summary, AI Read, or Save Content). **Never** runs in the background or monitors your screen automatically. |
| **Display Over Other Apps (Overlay)** | Show the floating sidebar on top of other applications | When the sidebar service is running (you can close it anytime) |
| **Internet / Network State** | Communicate with AI services, our backend, and load ads | When using AI features or Google Sign-In |
| **Foreground Service** | Keep the floating sidebar service running while you use other apps | When sidebar is active (shows persistent notification) |
| **Receive Boot Completed** | Optionally restart sidebar service after device reboot | Only if you enable auto-start in settings |
| **Media Projection (Android 11+)** | Capture screenshots when you tap "Save Content" | **Only when you grant explicit screenshot permission** and tap the save button. Never automatic. |

**Important:** We never monitor your screen in the background. Text extraction and screenshot capture occur **only** when you explicitly tap an action button in the sidebar. You maintain complete control.

---

## 5. Content & Intellectual Property

**Your Content:** You own all content you create or save. By using AI features, you grant us temporary rights to process your on-screen text solely for generating summaries. Backup content is subject to Google's terms.

**Our IP:** Arc's software, design, and features are owned by Rethink and protected by copyright. You may not copy, modify, or reverse engineer the app without permission.

---

## 6. AI Services & Disclaimers

We use Google Gemini API for summaries and your device's Text-to-Speech for audio. **Important:** AI summaries may not be 100% accurate and are for informational purposes only - not professional advice. Verify important information before relying on it.

## 7. Advertising

We display banner ads via Google AdMob for free users. We don't control ad content. Report inappropriate ads by contacting us. Ad-free premium plans may be offered in the future.
