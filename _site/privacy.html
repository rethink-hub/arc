  <h1>Privacy Policy for Arc: AI Reader &amp; Summary</h1>

<hr />

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to Arc: AI Reader &amp; Summary. This policy explains how we handle your data with transparency and care. Our goal is to provide powerful features while respecting your privacy at every step.</p>

<h2 id="our-core-privacy-promise">Our Core Privacy Promise</h2>

<p>Arc is built to be private by design. Our fundamental promise to you is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>You Are in Control:</strong> The app only accesses screen content when you explicitly tap an action in the floating sidebar. It never monitors your screen in the background.</li>
  <li><strong>Content is Processed, Never Stored on Servers:</strong> When we process your on-screen text for summaries, it is handled ephemerally and is <strong>never stored, saved, or logged on our servers.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Your Data Stays Yours:</strong> Any content you explicitly save is stored <strong>securely on your local device only.</strong> Protected by Android’s app sandbox, this data is accessible only to Arc and cannot be seen or accessed by us or other apps.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-we-handle-your-on-screen-data-sidebar-actions">How We Handle Your On-Screen Data (Sidebar Actions)</h2>

<p>When you interact with the floating sidebar, here is exactly what happens with your data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>For “AI Summary”:</strong> The text content from your screen is sent securely through our backend to the Google Gemini API to generate a summary. This data is used only for this purpose and is immediately discarded.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>For “AI Read”:</strong> The text content is processed in the same way as “AI Summary” to generate a summary first. The resulting summary text is then converted to speech <strong>entirely on your device</strong> using Android’s built-in Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine. Your data does not leave your device for the TTS function.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>For “Save Content”:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Consent Required:</strong> When you first tap “Save Content”, you’ll be asked for permission to capture screenshots. You can grant or deny this permission, and change your choice later in Settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Screenshot Capture (if permitted):</strong> If you grant permission, a screenshot of your current screen is captured and saved <strong>securely to your local device only</strong>. Screenshots are never taken automatically or in the background.</li>
      <li><strong>Text Processing:</strong> The on-screen text is processed for an AI summary (same as the “AI Summary” action).</li>
      <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Both the screenshot and summary are saved <strong>securely on your device in Android’s protected app storage</strong>. They are never uploaded to our servers unless you choose to back them up to Google Drive.</li>
      <li><strong>Full Control:</strong> You can delete saved content at any time from within the app, and you can change your screenshot permission in Settings.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="chat-with-ai-feature">Chat with AI Feature</h2>

<p>Arc allows you to have conversations about content on your screen through our Chat with AI feature.</p>

<h3 id="how-chat-data-is-handled">How Chat Data is Handled</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Chat History:</strong> All chat conversations are stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>. We do not store your chat history on our servers.</li>
  <li><strong>Message Processing:</strong> When you send a message, it is sent to our AI service (Google Gemini) along with the relevant context (screen content or summary) to generate a response. This data is processed ephemerally and not stored.</li>
  <li><strong>Screenshot Attachments:</strong> You can optionally attach screenshots to chat messages by tapping the screenshot button. These screenshots are:
    <ul>
      <li>Captured only when you explicitly tap the button</li>
      <li>Stored locally on your device with the chat message</li>
      <li>Sent to the AI only for that specific message to provide visual context</li>
      <li>Never stored on our servers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="chat-session-types">Chat Session Types</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Screen Chat:</strong> Discusses content currently on your screen</li>
  <li><strong>Summary Chat:</strong> Asks follow-up questions about generated summaries</li>
  <li><strong>Custom Action Chat:</strong> Discusses results from custom AI actions</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="custom-actions">Custom Actions</h2>

<p>Arc allows you to create personalized AI actions with custom prompts.</p>

<h3 id="local-custom-actions">Local Custom Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Your custom actions (name, icon, prompt, settings) are stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Screenshot Option:</strong> Each custom action can optionally capture screenshots when executed. This requires your initial screenshot consent.</li>
  <li><strong>Web Search Option:</strong> Custom actions can optionally use Google Search grounding to access real-time information. When enabled, your query and screen content may be sent to Google Search through the Gemini API.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-custom-actions-process-data">How Custom Actions Process Data</h3>

<p>When you execute a custom action:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Screen text is captured (only when you tap the action)</li>
  <li>Optional screenshot is captured (if enabled for that action)</li>
  <li>Your custom prompt and screen content are sent to the AI</li>
  <li>Results are displayed and can be saved locally</li>
  <li>Nothing is stored on our servers</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="community-actions">Community Actions</h2>

<p>Arc features a community where users can share and discover AI actions created by others.</p>

<h3 id="publishing-actions">Publishing Actions</h3>

<p>When you choose to <strong>publish</strong> a custom action to the community:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>What Becomes Public:</strong> Your action’s name, icon, and prompt template become publicly visible to all Arc users.</li>
  <li><strong>Your Identity:</strong> Your email address is displayed as the creator of the action.</li>
  <li><strong>Server Storage:</strong> Published actions are stored on our servers (AWS DynamoDB) to make them available to the community.</li>
  <li><strong>Upvotes:</strong> Other users can upvote your actions. Upvote counts are tracked on our servers.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="your-control-over-published-actions">Your Control Over Published Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Voluntary:</strong> Publishing is completely optional. You can use custom actions without ever publishing.</li>
  <li><strong>Unpublish Anytime:</strong> You can remove (unpublish) your actions from the community at any time through the app.</li>
  <li><strong>Independence:</strong> Deleting a local custom action does not affect its published version, and vice versa.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="using-community-actions">Using Community Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Adding Actions:</strong> When you add a community action to your sidebar, a copy is stored locally on your device.</li>
  <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> We do not track which community actions you add or use.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="app-management--installed-apps">App Management &amp; Installed Apps</h2>

<p>Arc includes an App Management feature that lets you control which apps Arc can work with.</p>

<h3 id="how-we-use-installed-app-information">How We Use Installed App Information</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Permission:</strong> Arc uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</code> permission to display a list of apps installed on your device.</li>
  <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This allows you to enable or disable Arc’s sidebar for specific apps (e.g., disable Arc in banking apps for privacy).</li>
  <li><strong>Local Only:</strong> The list of installed apps and your preferences are stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>. This information is <strong>never sent to our servers</strong> or shared with anyone.</li>
  <li><strong>Default Protection:</strong> Arc automatically disables itself for 400+ sensitive apps by default, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Banking and financial apps (200+ verified worldwide)</li>
      <li>Password managers</li>
      <li>Cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges</li>
      <li>Government and identity apps</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="screenshot-permissions--transparency">Screenshot Permissions &amp; Transparency</h2>

<p>We want to be completely transparent about how screenshots work in Arc:</p>

<h3 id="when-are-screenshots-taken">When Are Screenshots Taken?</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Only with explicit permission:</strong> You must grant screenshot permission when you first use a feature that requires it</li>
  <li><strong>Only when you tap the button:</strong> Screenshots are never captured automatically or in the background</li>
  <li><strong>You can deny or revoke permission:</strong> If you deny permission, content is still saved but without screenshots</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="screenshot-consent-levels">Screenshot Consent Levels</h3>

<p>Arc uses a tiered consent approach:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Save Content:</strong> Full consent dialog (Allow/Deny) because screenshot is automatic</li>
  <li><strong>Custom Actions:</strong> Info dialog when you enable screenshot toggle (you chose to enable it)</li>
  <li><strong>Screen Chat:</strong> Info dialog when you tap screenshot button (you explicitly requested it)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-happens-to-screenshots">What Happens to Screenshots?</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stored locally only:</strong> Screenshots are saved securely on your device</li>
  <li><strong>Never sent to servers:</strong> Screenshots never leave your device unless you explicitly choose Google Drive backup</li>
  <li><strong>You control deletion:</strong> Delete any saved content (including screenshots) at any time from the app</li>
  <li><strong>Android 11+ only:</strong> Screenshot capture requires Android 11 or higher. On older versions, content is saved without screenshots.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="where-are-screenshots-stored">Where Are Screenshots Stored?</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Location:</strong> Stored securely in your device’s internal storage (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/data/data/com.rethink.arc/files/screenshots/</code>)</li>
  <li><strong>Security:</strong> Protected by Android’s app sandbox; only accessible by Arc app</li>
  <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Not visible in your Gallery or to other apps</li>
  <li><strong>Backups:</strong> Only included in Google Drive backups if you explicitly enable that feature</li>
  <li><strong>Management:</strong> You can view and delete individual screenshots anytime in the app</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="on-device-language-detection">On-Device Language Detection</h2>

<p>Arc uses ML Kit Language Identification to automatically detect the language of content for text-to-speech.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Entirely On-Device:</strong> Language detection runs completely on your device using Google’s ML Kit.</li>
  <li><strong>No Data Sent:</strong> No text is sent to external servers for language detection.</li>
  <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Enables automatic voice selection to match the content’s language for natural pronunciation.</li>
  <li><strong>User Control:</strong> You can disable auto-voice selection in Speech Settings to use a fixed voice.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="information-we-handle-for-other-features">Information We Handle for Other Features</h2>

<h4 id="optional-account-information-if-you-choose-to-sign-in"><strong>Optional Account Information (If You Choose to Sign In)</strong></h4>

<p>Arc is fully functional without an account. However, to enable optional features like Google Drive backup and Community Actions, you can choose to create an account using Google Sign-In.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>What We Collect:</strong> If you sign in, we collect only your <strong>Google ID</strong> and <strong>Email Address</strong>. This minimal data is stored securely on our backend servers (hosted on AWS) to identify your account.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>What We DON’T Collect:</strong> We explicitly do NOT collect or store:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your full name</li>
      <li>Profile picture</li>
      <li>Any other profile information</li>
      <li>Friends list or contacts</li>
      <li>Files from your Google Drive</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="third-party-services--data-sharing">Third-Party Services &amp; Data Sharing</h2>

<p>We use reputable third-party services and only share the minimum data necessary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Google Gemini API:</strong> Primary AI service for generating summaries, processing custom actions, and chat conversations. When you use these features, we send the relevant text to Google’s servers for processing. <strong>This text is used only to generate your response and is not stored by us.</strong> (<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Google Search Grounding:</strong> When web search is enabled for custom actions, your content may be sent to Google Search through the Gemini API to access real-time information. (<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>OpenAI (Fallback):</strong> Available as a fallback AI provider if Gemini is unavailable. Same data handling principles apply. (<a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy">OpenAI Privacy Policy</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS):</strong> Our backend, which handles AI requests and stores account information, is hosted on AWS in the <strong>us-east-1</strong> region (Virginia, USA). All data transmission uses encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS). (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/">AWS Privacy Policy</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Google Services:</strong> For optional Sign-In and Drive Backup features.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>ML Kit Language ID:</strong> On-device language detection. No data is sent to external servers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Google Play In-App Review:</strong> We use Google’s In-App Review API to occasionally prompt for app reviews. This is handled entirely by Google Play and we do not collect any data about your review.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We will never sell your personal information.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="google-oauth-scopes">Google OAuth Scopes</h2>

<p>We use Google Sign-In for two separate, optional features:</p>

<p><strong>1. Account Authentication (Optional):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Scopes:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openid</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">email</code></li>
  <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Create and authenticate your account</li>
  <li><strong>Access:</strong> Email address only (no profile, no Drive access)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Google Drive Backup (Optional - Requires Separate Consent):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Scope:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appdata</code></li>
  <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Backup and restore your saved summaries</li>
  <li><strong>Access:</strong> ONLY the app-specific hidden folder (appDataFolder)</li>
  <li><strong>Limitation:</strong> Cannot access any other files in your Drive or other apps’ data</li>
</ul>

<p>Both features are completely optional and can be used independently or not at all.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="data-security--retention">Data Security &amp; Retention</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data in Transit:</strong> All network communications use HTTPS/TLS encryption to protect data while it travels between your device and our servers.</li>
      <li><strong>Local Device Storage:</strong> Data saved on your device is protected by Android’s app sandbox security model, which isolates your app data and makes it accessible only to Arc (not to us, other apps, or other users of your device).</li>
      <li><strong>Server Storage:</strong> Account information stored on our AWS servers is protected by AWS security measures and access controls.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Retention:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>On-screen text for summaries: Never retained</li>
      <li>Chat conversations: Local only, until you delete them</li>
      <li>Custom actions: Local only, until you delete them</li>
      <li>Published community actions: Server-stored until you unpublish</li>
      <li>Your local data: Remains until you delete it</li>
      <li>Your account information: Retained as long as your account is active</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="your-rights-and-choices">Your Rights and Choices</h2>

<p>You have full control over your data. You can manage and delete your locally stored content, revoke permissions in your device settings, and request account deletion by contacting us. Using features like Google Sign-In and Google Drive Backup is completely optional.</p>
